	/**
	 * The PeriCfgScanner class represents a class that can be instantiated. PeriCfgScanner 
	 * objects are used to send reports containing Periodic data, that is, data sampled during
	 * fixed periods. It buffers any data value changes to be sent as part of a periodic report.
	 * Event reports shall be sent with a time interval equal to the Reporting-Interval 
	 * attribute value. The number of observations for each metric object is dependent on the 
	 * metric object’s update interval and the scanner’s Reporting-Interval.
	 * Example: A periodic configurable scanner is set up to “scan” two metric objects with a 
	 * Reporting-Interval of 1 s. The two objects update their corresponding observed value 
	 * periodically with an interval of 1 s and 1⁄2 s, respectively. The periodic configurable 
	 * scanner then issues event reports every second containing one observation scan of metric
	 * object #1 and two observation scans of metric object #2.
