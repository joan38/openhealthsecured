		 * the complete Fixed-Segment-Data is transferred or the transfer is aborted by the manager 
		 * or agent. See Transfer PM-segment content in 8.9.3.4.2 for a full description.

		 * possible to reduce the number of messages required for the transfer of the segment.
		 * Support for the event by the agent is mandatory if the agent supports PM-store objects.
