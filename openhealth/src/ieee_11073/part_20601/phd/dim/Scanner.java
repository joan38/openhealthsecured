	/**
	 * A scanner object is an observer and “summarizer” of object attribute values. It observes 
	 * attributes of metric objects (e.g., numeric objects) and generates summaries in the form 
	 * of notification event reports.
	 * The scanner class is an abstract class defining attributes, methods, events, and services
	 * that are common for its subclasses. As such, it cannot be instantiated.
	 * The scanner concept provides three different event report notifications: variable format, 
	 * fixed format, and grouped format. See 7.4.5 for the reporting of observed object attributes.
	 * The event report formats are described further in 6.3.9.4.5, 6.3.9.5.5, and A.11.5, 
	 * respectively.
	 * More specialized scanner classes are derived from the scanner base class.
